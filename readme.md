I am a 20 years computer engeneering student from Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. I am fascinated to learn new tecnologies and share knowledge. I am studying and working at languages like C, C++, C#, to low level applications, and Python to high level softwares. I like to work on scientific (emphasis in physics and mathematics) applications to computer and data science. I am currently working on data science projects applied to video encodind and decoding.
